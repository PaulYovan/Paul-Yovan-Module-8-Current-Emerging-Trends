# Paul-Yovan-Module-8-Current-Emerging-Trends

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

  I was given most of the code for this project and only implemented variables and loops to help the AI learn for each episode. I implemented an Epsilon-Greedy algorithm to help the AI explore the maze in the beginning and then convert to using exploitation when it would win consecutively.

  # What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

   Computer scientists help develop applications that end up helping make some tasks automated that weren't before which matters because it can end up helping a lot of people save time throughout their day and overall make certain matters more convenient to do.

   # How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

   I approach problems by first assessing what needs to be done with the problem and then segment that problem into specific tasks that can be done either throughout the day or throughout any given deadline.

   # What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

   My ethical responsibilities consist of me knowing the training data that the AI is using to ensure that there is no implicit bias that the AI may be picking up on, it is also my responsibility to ensure that the user knows what may be collected for using the program the AI is on so that they understand what part of their information is being used when using the program.
